# Comparison-among-serial-pthread-and-OpenMP-via-Julia-Set

Julia sets: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set.

We utilize Julia sets to compare the performance of serial, pthread and OpenMP. We can compare the performance of pthread and OpenMP by ploting a graph with respect to running time and number of threads(See Julia Set Comparison.pdf).
